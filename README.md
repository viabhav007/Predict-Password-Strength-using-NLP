# Predict-Password-Strength-using-NLP
Building a model that will help us predict whether our password is of good strength, average strength or poor strength. We will be making use
of TF(term frequency)-IDF(inverse document frequency) vectorizer algorithm on our provided data. Then using logistic regression to get the
final output. We also tend to notice that on computing the values, the data tends to belong to strength of 1 which is unfair for any future data
and has been taken care of by providing robustness to the model.
